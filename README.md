project: A Responsive website, mobile first,  with direct updated news for people stuck in a foreign country.

With the covid-19 crisis many people are stuck in foreign country and are trying to get back home, looking for urgent informations.
The idea is to create a website, mobile first, that centralizes all the informations needed.
Informations from the embassies, newspapers and flight companies.

The idea is to deploy a very SIMPLE, QUICK and EFFECTIVE solution.

We start with French people stuck in Peru , but make the code scalable to be used for any countries.

Any advises or help to improve the project is very welcome!!Don't hesitate to join to the project to help people there.
